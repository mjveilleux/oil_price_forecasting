# Oil Price Forecasting

This is a web app for plotting ANS oil price forecasts. Using Selenium, Data is scaped from Alaska's Department of Revenue's Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices service (ANS prices) and the Energy Information Administration (Cushing Crude Oil futures). Currently the forecasts provided serve as a baseline for future, more accurate forecasts. For an overview of forecasting oil prices see file fed_forecasting_oil_price.pdf in the repository.
